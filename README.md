# Reddit-memes-scraper
I tried scraping memes from my favorite subreddits 
<br>
<li>app.py conatins the scripts that scrapes the data</li>
<li>.ipynb file was just used to get a list of some subreddits that posts memes
<li>The memes.rar contains some memes scraped , cannot ipload all here
 
<p> To run this , make sure you have all the dependencies installed </p>
<br>
Make sure you have your secret key and client key
<p>
<ol> Have a folder directory named 'memes', this is where the files will be saved
